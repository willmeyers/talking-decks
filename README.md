# Talking‚Ä¢Decks

Community made, annotated [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) decks for language learning. Powered by [Play.ht](https://play.ht).

## Why does this exist?

1) I think this is kind of neat.
2) The script I wrote can be easily extended to other applications.
3) Collaborative learning tools are cool.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a linguist, and I'm not a native speaker of any of the languages I'm making decks for. I'm just a guy who likes open source education tools.

Those of you who are native speakers, you'll probably be able to tell I made the decks using ChatGPT ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Feel free to contribute if you want to improve the quality!
