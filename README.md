# Talkingâ€¢Decks

Community made, annotated [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) decks for language learning.

## Why does this exist?

I'm trying to learn a new language and instead of actually studying I wrote software to hopefully make it easier to learn one.
It's a supplemental resource to help you learn a language, not a replacement for actually studying obviously.

There's code in there to help make your own annotated decks. We encourage you to open a PR once you've made a deck so others can benefit from your work!

## Disclaimer

I'm not a linguist, and I'm not a native speaker of any of the languages I'm making decks for. I'm just a guy who likes open source education tools.

Those of you who are native speakers, you'll probably be able to tell I made the decks using ChatGPT... Feel free to contribute if you want to improve the quality!
